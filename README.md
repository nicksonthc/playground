# Playground Application

This project is a React-based interactive application that showcases various algorithms, simulations, and tools. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

The Playground application provides an engaging way to explore and interact with:
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Visualize and understand how different pathfinding techniques work.
- **Game Theory Simulations**: Experiment with game theory concepts like Nash equilibrium.
- **Project Quotation Calculator**: Calculate project costs based on resources, timelines, and overheads.

## Pages and Features

### Home
- **Description**: The landing page introduces the application and provides links to explore the features.
- **Path**: `/`

### Pathfinding Algorithms
- **Description**: Visualize pathfinding techniques like A* and interact with a grid-based simulation.
- **Path**: `/pathfinding`

### Game Theory
- **Description**: Simulate game theory strategies and analyze results with visualizations and history tracking.
- **Path**: `/game-theory`

### Project Quotation Calculator
- **Description**: Calculate project costs and generate quotations based on input parameters like headcount, days, and profit margin.
- **Path**: `/project-calculator`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
